1. Hubs (Dynamic Spaces)

Instead of just "groups", Cozy has Hubs.

Each Hub adapts to its theme:

Developer Hub → code snippets, live coding rooms, GitHub integration

Gamer Hub → leaderboard, live Twitch/YouTube integration, match-making

Crypto Hub → live charts, portfolio sharing, market sentiment polls

News Hub → AI-curated feeds, discussions, “fact-check” button from the community

UI feels alive depending on the hub type (e.g., dark neon for gamers, minimal grid for developers).

2. Zones (Layered Communities)

A community isn’t just a flat feed → it has Zones.

Example: In a Gaming community:

🎮 Arcade Zone → memes, fun talk

⚔️ Battle Zone → competitive match coordination

📰 Patch Zone → official updates, pinned news

Each zone has its own vibe and permissions → so communities feel like mini-worlds, not just chatrooms.

3. Cozy Realms (Interest Universes)

Users don’t just join a community, they enter a Realm.

A Realm can host nested micro-communities inside it.

Example:

Crypto Realm → Ethereum, Bitcoin, Memecoins sub-realms

Dev Realm → Web Dev, AI, Blockchain sub-realms

Realms can have cross-connections (e.g., a developer realm linking with a crypto realm for “Web3 Devs”).

4. Pulse Communities (Live-first)

Instead of static feeds, Pulse communities are real-time energy-driven spaces.

Feeds flow like a heartbeat — trending posts rise and fade dynamically (no infinite scroll dead zone).

Great for fast-moving worlds like news, esports, trading.

Posts can expire after 24h unless upvoted/saved → so discussions are always fresh and alive.

5. Persona-based Communities

In certain Cozy communities, users can post using Personas.

Example: In a Crypto Traders community, someone might switch to their "Trader Persona" showing portfolio style, but not real identity.

In Gaming, players could post as their gaming alias/character.

This lets people switch identities per community, making interaction feel more immersive.

6. Interactive Communities

Every community has built-in interactive modules:

Dev → collaborative code editor

Gamer → battle bracket generator

Crypto → shared watchlists, prediction markets

News → quick polls on world events, live community-sourced timelines

No other platform makes interactivity part of the community itself (usually just text + chat).

🚀 With this style, Cozy wouldn’t just be “groups” → it would feel like entering different worlds, each designed for the culture inside it.
