🔥 Mini Monetization Ideas (not too broad)

Premium Badge/Verification – users can pay small to verify & get a gold badge.

Custom Themes/Avatars – mini marketplace for profile skins, color themes, emojis, or animated pfp frames.

Ad Spots in Communities – small banner placements (non-intrusive, like Discord server boosts).

Boosted Posts/Communities – let users pay to feature a post or community at the top for a short time.

Tipping System – lightweight (coins, credits, or Supabase balance) → users can tip others for helpful posts.
